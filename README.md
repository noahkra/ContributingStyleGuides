# So you want to contribute to my repositories?
That's great! Welcome aboard :)

Before you begin though please read the following styleguides to make sure we keep the project repositories consistent and high quality!

###### Note: the code examples here will be in nodejs syntax, since that's what I work with mostly. However if any other languages are to occur in my projects you should still follow these styleguides. Some of them even have exceptions for specific languages!

## Styleguides

### Commits
###### Note for my CLI git friends: "commit title" is the fist line of a commit message, "commit description" is the rest of it.

#### Titles
- Commit titles should contain a short, general description of the *effect* of the changes.  
*(E.g. ``Fix startup bug`` instead of ``Update app.js``)*
  - If this isn't possible for any reason, commit titles should contain a short, general description of the action performed.  
    *(E.g. ``Add settings file``)*
- Commit titles should always be in present tense.
#### Descriptions
- Commit descriptions should contained an explaination of every change in the commit. More detail is better.
  - Commit descriptions are not required for simple changes for which the commit title provides enough explanation.
- Commit descriptions should mention any relevant issues/pull requests.
